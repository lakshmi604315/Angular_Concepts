<!-- How to create a repositiory and push your local changes to git


Let's try signing up for GitHub using the correct link:

1.Create a GitHub Account:

Go to the GitHub website: https://github.com/
Click on the "Sign up" button.
Fill in the required information: username, email, and password.
Choose a plan (you can start with the free plan).
Complete the sign-up process by verifying your email address.


Great! Now that you've completed the signup process for GitHub, let's proceed with creating a repository and pushing your code from your local machine to GitHub. Here's a step-by-step guide:

2.Create a New Repository:

Log in to your GitHub account.
Click on the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository".
Enter a name for your repository.
Optionally, add a description for your repository.
Choose the visibility of your repository (public or private).
Optionally, initialize the repository with a README file, .gitignore, or license.
Click on the "Create repository" button.
Initialize a Git Repository Locally:

1.git init
2.git add .
3.git commit -m "Initial commit"
4.git remote add origin <remote_repository_URL>
5.git push -u origin master


while doing commit you might get this error :

so follow the below two steps :

1.git config --global user.name "Your Name"
2.git config --global user.email "you@example.com"

then commit and remote add and finally push it works now.. -->
